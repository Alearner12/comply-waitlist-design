# Healthcare Client Acquisition Strategy

## Target Audience: "Low-Tech" Healthcare Clients
Focus on clients who are "not well aware of technology" and rely on outdated templates (potential compliance landmines).
Target those with ~5-year-old designs that violate the May 2026 DOJ/HHS deadline.

## 1. Where to find them
Look for specific "Local" indicators (No paid lead list needed):

*   **Single-Doctor Private Practices**: Search "Family Doctor near [City]" or "Pediatrician near [City]". Look for 2018-era sites (no in-house IT).
*   **Independent Dental Clinics**: Targets for "serial litigants" due to complex, non-keyboard-friendly forms.
*   **Local Specialized Clinics**: Physical therapy, Mental Health, Chiropractors. Often use "all-in-one" builders with poor accessibility.
*   **Non-Profit Medical Centers**: High traffic, low budget for web updates.

## 2. The "3-Second Scan" (Lead Identification)
Red flags indicating high risk:

*   **PDF Forms**: "New Patient" forms that must be downloaded/printed. #1 source of accessibility lawsuits.
*   **The "Overlay" Widget**: Small blue accessibility icons (AccessiBe, AudioEye). Courts have ruled these don't stop lawsuits.
*   **No "Skip to Content" link**: Press `Tab` on load. If no "Skip to main content" button appears, it's a red flag.

## 3. The "Non-Tech" Sales Pitch
Focus on Government Deadlines and Patient Access, not tech stack (React/Supabase).

**Subject**: Your clinic's website and the May 2026 HHS Deadline

**Body**:
> Hi Dr. [Name],
>
> I was looking at your website and noticed it’s missing a few of the technical requirements mandated by the new Department of Health (HHS) Section 504 ruling.
>
> Most private practices aren't aware that the May 2026 deadline requires all patient-facing sites to be fully accessible. I’m the founder of GetComply, and we’re helping healthcare teams automate this transition so you can focus on patients instead of lawsuits.
>
> I've reserved a spot for your clinic on our early-access list. Would you like me to send over a quick 1-minute report of what needs to be fixed?

## 4. Why Healthcare over E-commerce?
*   **E-commerce**: Uses Shopify/Wix (decent built-in accessibility). They are "tech-aware."
*   **Healthcare**: Uses custom legacy sites or old Wordpress themes. They lack knowledge of ARIA labels or contrast ratios. They need a dedicated solution.
